# Tabpanels

The {'<Tabpanels>'} component just provides a convenient wrapper for all the tabpanel components.

```
<Tabpanels>
    <Tabpanel id="..."></Tabpanel>
    <Tabpanel id="..."></Tabpanel>
    <Tabpanel id="..."></Tabpanel>
    ...
</Tabpanels>

```

This component <strong>is not strictly necessary</strong> and its use is totally optional.

I used this wrapper in order to realize a subtle transition between panels when the user changes the active tab.

The wrapper has `display: grid` and applies `grid-area: 1 / 1` to its children, so they can overlap  
each other and completely fill the wrapper. This allows for a simple seamless crossfade effect between
panels <i>(see the \_animations.scss file for the specific implementation)</i>.

For this purpose I used `@starting-style` to properly trigger a transition of hidden panels and set
`transition-behavior: allow-discrete` to animate the `display` property (both these features are now
baseline for all major browsers).

Of course, this effect respects the user's settings and will not be triggered if `prefers-reduced-motion`
is set to `reduce`.
