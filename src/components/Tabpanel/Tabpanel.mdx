# Tabpanel

The {'<Tabpanel>'} component provides a wrapper for the content of a single tabpanel and accepts an `id`
property. The `id` must be unique among its siblings panels and must match one of the {'<Tab>'} ids.

A story is not provided here because a {'<Tabpanel>'} component would be hidden by default
(their visibility depends on the active tab, so refer to TabContainer story to see it in action).

```
<Tabpanel id="..."></Tabpanel>
```
