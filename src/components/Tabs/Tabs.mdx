# Tabs

This component is a wrapper for {'<Tab>'} components.

It provides both a simple {'<div>'} container for the button elements and a context to optionally set
the value of the `variant` prop for every children.

If the `variant` is set in this element it will override any `variant` property
applied on the children. This behaviour is shown in the example below:
If you click the **show code** button the third and fourth button have their own
`variant` property applied, but the {'<Tab>'} component will check first for
the context created by {'<Tabs>'}

This component only shows the basic style of the tab list. To see a fully functional component
see the {'<Tabcontainer>'} story which also includes some tabpanels
