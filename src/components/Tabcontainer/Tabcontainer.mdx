# Tabcontainer

This component is a wrapper for {'<Tabs>'} and {'<Tabpanels>'} components.

It provides a simple container for all the components,
and makes the tabs properly work on click and keydown events.

It also returns a provider to set both the id of the selected tab and
a unique identifier, in order to avoid potential name duplications that would make the markup invalid.

It accepts an optional `initialSelectedTab` property to select one of the tabs, if its ID matches with
one of those provided in a {'<Tab>'} element. If no `initialSelectedTab` property is passed to the component, no tabs
will be preselected and no panels will be active.
