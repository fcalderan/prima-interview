# Tabcontainer

This component is a wrapper for {'<Tabs>'} and {'<Tabpanels>'} components.

It provides a simple container for all the components,
and makes the tabs properly work on click and keydown events.

It also set context provider to set both the id of the selected tab and
a unique identifier to avoid potential name duplications making the markup invalid.

It accepts an optional `initialSelectedTab` property to select one of the tabs, if its ID matches with
one of those provided in a {'<Tab>'} element. If no property is passed to the component, no tabs
will be preselected and no panels will be active.
